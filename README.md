1. Project description:
Just a silly game that probably only appeals to one (1) person (me). Making it has made me realize I don't want to make games ever, LOL.

2. Prerequisites:
You're gonna need Python 3 and the Arcade library, which you can install by running pip install arcade in your CLI.

3. How to run:
Just run python main.py in your CLI.

4. Controls:
Use the arrows to go left/right and E to interact. That's it.

5. Credits:
The Mohg & Ansbach sprites are from a lovely artist friend of mine: https://newgroundstier.tumblr.com/
The Tarnished sprite I got from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPeXp0udd68
